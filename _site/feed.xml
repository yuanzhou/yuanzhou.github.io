We drink too much; smoke too much; spend too recklessly; laugh too little; drive too fast; get too angry quickly; stay up too late; get up too tired; read too seldom; watch TV too much and pray too seldom.</p>

<p>We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values; we fly in faster planes to arrive there quicker, to do less and return sooner; we sign more contracts only to realize fewer profits; we talk too much; love too seldom and lie too often. We’ve learned how to make a living, but not a life; we’ve added years to life, not life to years. We’ve been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet the new neighbor. We’ve conquered outer space, but not inner space; we’ve done larger things, but not better things; we’ve cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul; we’ve split the atom, but not our prejudice; we write more, but learn less; plan more, but accomplish less; we make faster planes, but longer lines; we learned to rush, but not to wait; we have more weapons, but less peace; higher incomes, but lower morals; more parties, but less fun; more food, but less appeasement; more acquaintances, but fewer friends; more effort, but less success. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but have less communication; drive smaller cars that have bigger problems; build larger factories that produce less. We’ve become long on quantity, but short on quality.</p>

<p>These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion; tall men, but short character; steep in profits, but shallow relationships. These are times of world peace, but domestic warfare; more leisure and less fun; higher postage, but slower mail; more kinds of food, but less nutrition. These are days of two incomes, but more divorces; these are times of fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, cartridge living, thow-away morality, one-night stands, overweight bodies and pills that do everything from cheer, to prevent, quiet or kill. It is a time when there is much in the show window and nothing in the stock room. Indeed, these are the times!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="awareness" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original version by Dr. Bob Moorehead]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Clayton 392 performance coil package installed</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jeep/2024/04/28/clayton-coils.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Clayton 392 performance coil package installed" /><published>2024-04-28T09:29:18-04:00</published><updated>2024-04-28T09:29:18-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jeep/2024/04/28/clayton-coils</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jeep/2024/04/28/clayton-coils.html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been doing research on improving the 392 on-road handling and also mild off-roading. Following the footsteps of several members, I bought the Clayton 392 performance coil package (essentially 2.5” coils front and 1.5” rear) last year and finally got a chance to get them installed in the driveway.</p>

<h2 id="first-attempt-failed">First attempt failed</h2>

<p>Back in winter when I attempted for the first time, I was trying to do the 5-tire rotation at the same time, only lifted one corner at a time. I started with rear right but couldn’t droop the axle low enough to put int the new coil while having other tires on the ground. So I took a long break and also because it was cold out there.</p>

<h2 id="second-attempt-succeeded">Second attempt succeeded</h2>

<p>This time I kept all tires on and jacked up the front with my homemade wheel crib to get extra lift. Unbolted lower shock bolt and swaybar end link bolt to axle, one corner at a time. The front was easy and I also unscrewed the brake line bracket from LCAs. The rear was slower than I thought due to I didn’t know how to unplug the diff e-locker cable harness (I don’t think it’s really needed since the e-parking brake cable became the limiting factor) and I also had to unbolted the track bar axle mount. The e-parking brake cable was very tight when I drooped the rear, I didn’t want to relocate the cable to under the crossmember this time. I used my breaker bar to pry the rear left coil in place.</p>

<p>I used the torque specs as shown below. 60 ft-lb sway bar link to axle, 75 ft-lb lower shock to axle, and 90 ft-lb for the rear track bar to axle.</p>

<h2 id="beforeafter-comparison">Before/After comparison</h2>

<p>My 392 XR is 2-year old, so all the factory coils have settled. It was 40-1/4” front and rear from floor to the fender flare across the center line of wheel hub. But the front door bottom pinch or rock slider is 1” lower than the rear, so it was definitely not level due to the factory rake. And I don’t have a winch.</p>

<p>After the new coils, I waited for two days so things can settle a bit. Now the rear is 1/2” taller and the front is 1-1/2” taller (which also gives me more uptravel). I consider my jeep is level currently. The on-road handling is better too, more sporty and less floaty.</p>

<p>Due to this 1-1/2” increased height, I also measured the center of front axle only shifted to the driver side maybe 1/16”, no need to change the track bar. Will do more search on steering components later if I’ll ever upgrade.</p>

<p>Their rear coils are dual rate spring (137/200 lbs/in) and the right spring is taller than the left one to offset the gas tank weight. They marked with L and R so pay attention and don’t use the right side spring on the rear left otherwise you’ll have a lean to the right side. Due to this dual spring rate, I also noticed the rear sags 1/4” when my two little kids sit in the back. Because it compress the the top par of the spring at 137 lbs/in. orum member also commented “the rear sag was slightly greater than stock”. I think it’ll take a lot weight to fully sag the second part of the spring at 200 lbs/in, and their 1.5” springs are still stronger than the factory ones.</p>

Made a very solid wheel cribs set and the extra 9” helped a ton for replacing the LCAs. I did use the floor jack extension handle together with the breaker bar to break loose the bolts, not bad. Also used the cribs as leverage when I torqued the bolts to 190 ft-lbs. Had to jack up the frame on passenger side to align the holes but no need for the driver side. My 90-teeth flex head torque wrench also helped give it more flexibility.</p>

<p>Reporting back after two weeks highway and local runs. I did retorque the bolts. The steering feels tighter and has better return-to-center. I had a slight left pull before the swap, now a bit right pull sometimes, I think it’s all due to road crown. Doesn’t bother me at all. Got the caster angles checked again, see before and after numbers for reference. My Jeep tracks better. No regrets.</p>

My 90-teeth flex head torque wrench also helped give it more flexibility.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Differential Cover and Fluid Change</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jeep/2022/11/13/diff-covers.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Differential Cover and Fluid Change" /><published>2022-11-13T09:22:28-05:00</published><updated>2022-11-13T09:22:28-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jeep/2022/11/13/diff-covers</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jeep/2022/11/13/diff-covers.html"><![CDATA[<p>So I got the diff covers replaced today. Went with RuffStuff 1/4” thick ring and 3/8” cover. Really beefy and beautifully welded. Quality hardwares. Perfect fitment as well.</p>

<p>At 7500 miles, the rear fluid pretty dark already with normal metal shaving at the refill plug magnet.</p>

<p>I cleaned and reused the gaskets. Refilled with 75W-140. The FlexFill pouch worked well and I also jacked up the frame to gain more clearance which also helped when torquing the bolts. It was my fault that didn’t plan very well. I refilled two pouches in rear and still didn’t see the level close to the refill hole. Did a bit search on the capacity again. Pumped about 0.4-0.5 quart out to use for front.</p>

<p>I had to jack up the frame near driver side front for room to work on the bolts. Refilled one whole pouch, then used 0.3 ish pumped out from the rear diff. It’s hard to measure the exact volume just by looking at the pouch. But I think I got the balance as close as I could. So 1.6 quart rear and 1.3qt front. Spilled a bit but should be fine.</p>

<p>Torqued the 12-point bolts to 25 foot-pound using my harbor freight torque wrench which I think should be fine.</p>

<p>All in all, took me 4 hours. I did not rush and I’m very happy about the end result. Not sure if any mpg difference with using 75W-140. My 392 only gets me 13.5 mpg on average and I can live with it.</p>
