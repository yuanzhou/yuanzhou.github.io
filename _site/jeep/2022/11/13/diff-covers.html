    <p>So I got the diff covers replaced today. Went with RuffStuff 1/4” thick ring and 3/8” cover. Really beefy and beautifully welded. Quality hardwares. Perfect fitment as well.</p>

<p>At 7500 miles, the rear fluid pretty dark already with normal metal shaving at the refill plug magnet.</p>

<p>I cleaned and reused the gaskets. Refilled with 75W-140. The FlexFill pouch worked well and I also jacked up the frame to gain more clearance which also helped when torquing the bolts. It was my fault that didn’t plan very well. I refilled two pouches in rear and still didn’t see the level close to the refill hole. Did a bit search on the capacity again. Pumped about 0.4-0.5 quart out to use for front.</p>

<p>I had to jack up the frame near driver side front for room to work on the bolts. Refilled one whole pouch, then used 0.3 ish pumped out from the rear diff. It’s hard to measure the exact volume just by looking at the pouch. But I think I got the balance as close as I could. So 1.6 quart rear and 1.3qt front. Spilled a bit but should be fine.</p>

<p>Torqued the 12-point bolts to 25 foot-pound using my harbor freight torque wrench which I think should be fine.</p>

<p>All in all, took me 4 hours. I did not rush and I’m very happy about the end result. Not sure if any mpg difference with using 75W-140. My 392 only gets me 13.5 mpg on average and I can live with it.</p>
