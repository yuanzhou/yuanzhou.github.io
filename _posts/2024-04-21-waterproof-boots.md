Recently I became interested in leather boots waterproofing. After my first pair of 8" Lumberjack from Silverado Boots got delivered, I coulnd't wait to get my hands on them using the Huberd's Shoe Grease. I'm surprised how the greese has darkened the color of the leather.

I also did the same to my old Captain StormKing from Thursday Boots.
