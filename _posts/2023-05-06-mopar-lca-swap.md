Another weekend project and it was fun. Made a very solid wheel cribs set and the extra 9" helped a ton for replacing the LCAs. I did use the floor jack extension handle together with the breaker bar to break loose the bolts, not bad. Also used the cribs as leverage when I torqued the bolts to 190 ft-lbs. Had to jack up the frame on passenger side to align the holes but no need for the driver side. My 90-teeth flex head torque wrench also helped give it more flexibility.

Reporting back after two weeks highway and local runs. I did retorque the bolts. The steering feels tighter and has better return-to-center. I had a slight left pull before the swap, now a bit right pull sometimes, I think it's all due to road crown. Doesn't bother me at all. Got the caster angles checked again, see before and after numbers for reference. My Jeep tracks better. No regrets.
